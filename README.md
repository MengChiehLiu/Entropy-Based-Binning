# Entropy-Based-Binning

The function here is designed for binning dependent variables, in the way minimizing total entropy of corresponding response.  
Make sure u put the test file into correct path, which is "sample_data/" in google colab

## Structure

### Entropy
Using scipy.stats.entropy to calculate the entropy of bins


## Use guide
The function here is designd for binary response only, if ur response is not binary, u should change the entropy base and revise the probability and entropy calculating on your own, hich is not that difficult, so I just skip the tutorial.
